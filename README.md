## Gameplay

Villages manage themselves, focusing on resource production (Gold, Technologies), unit development (Swordsman, with levels based on Barracks), and infrastructure upgrades (Town Hall, Gold Mine, Lab, Barracks).

Players can spend SOL to:

- Buy Gold for their friendly village (price adjusts based on village income).
- Sabotage the enemy village (enemy units temporarily retreat).
- Trigger a Lightning Strike on a selected enemy building, forcing them to spend resources and time on repairs.

At any point, either village can initiate an attack on the other, playing out on a 3x10 bridge battlefield.

## Prediction Market Integration

Prediction Village uniquely integrates a prediction market directly into its gameplay. This market allows players to speculate on various game events, leveraging their understanding of the game dynamics.

- Users can predict outcomes related to unit types and village development (e.g., "Barracks will reach level 7 by tomorrow," or "The Human village will be destroyed").
- Prediction markets offer Yes/No options, with share prices reflecting the current probability of the event.
- Probability is dynamically influenced by the volume and pricing of bought Yes/No shares.
- Users can trade their prediction shares at any time. Correct predictions yield $1 per share.

## ü§ñ AI Assistance

An integrated LLM AI analyzes the game state, prediction market activity, and player wallet balances to suggest potentially profitable predictions and strategic in-game actions. The AI aims to identify likely future events, helping players make informed decisions.

## Core Technology

The entire game logic and the prediction market are implemented as smart contracts on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. All in-game actions are algorithmically executed every second.
